# Data Mart Using SSIS
- A data mart is a subset of a data warehouse that is focused on a specific business area or team, such as sales, finance, or marketing. It is designed to meet the specific needs of a particular group of users who need access to a specific segment of data for analysis and decision-making purposes.

 # Setting Up SSIS

- Create an SSIS Project: In Visual Studio with SSDT, create a new Integration Services project.
