# Data Mart Using SSIS
- A data mart is a subset of a data warehouse that is focused on a specific business area or team, such as sales, finance, or marketing. It is designed to meet the specific needs of a particular group of users who need access to a specific segment of data for analysis and decision-making purposes.

##**There are three main types of data marts:**

Independent Data Marts: These are developed without a centralized data warehouse and are created by extracting data directly from operational systems or external sources.
Dependent Data Marts: These are created from a centralized data warehouse. This ensures that the data mart contains consistent, cleansed, and integrated data.
Hybrid Data Marts: These combine input from existing data warehouses with additional operational source data.

 # Setting Up SSIS
- Install SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT): SSDT includes templates and tools for building SSIS packages.
- Create an SSIS Project: In Visual Studio with SSDT, create a new Integration Services project.
